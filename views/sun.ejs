            <h4>The Sun</h4>
            <p class="flow-text left-align light">The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.
              <br>
              <br>
              The Sun accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.
              <br>
              <br>
              The Sun formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.
              <br>
              <br>
              The Sun is roughly middle-aged; it has not changed dramatically for more than four billion years, and will remain fairly stable for more than another five billion years. After hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to the point at which it is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, the core of the Sun will experience a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand to eventually become a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large enough to engulf the current orbits of Mercury, Venus, and probably Earth.

          <p><i>How many Earths would fit inside the Sun?</i></p>
          <p>The Sun comprises some 99.86% of the mass of the Solar System, and measures 1.39 million kilometers in diameter.</p>
          <p>That means there would be room for 1.3 million Earths inside the Sun!</p>
