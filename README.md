# A New Yorker's Guide to Scale in the Solar System

While I was researching my first project ('Save Our Satellites' game) at GA, I first thought of the incredible displays at The Rose Center for Earth and Space at the American Museum of Natural History. Also, I came across a number of really cool JavaScript/CSS models of our solar system and other stellar imagery.  All of these are informative and fun, giving a good sense of the names and order of the planets, and their orbital paths and relative speeds.

BUT, there was one thing with which they all struggle: it's hard to convey a sense of the scale of the solar system.

I wondered how I could relate the relative sizes and distances of the planets in our solar system to something I could better understand: the geography of my home, New York City.

This web project is a thought experiment that seeks to let the user appreciate the how small the Big Apple is on a cosmic scale.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
